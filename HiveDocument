HIVE:

The Hadoop ecosystem component, Apache Hive, is an open source data warehouse system for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in Hadoop files. Hive do three main functions: data summarization, query, and analysis.

Hive use language called HiveQL (HQL), which is similar to SQL. HiveQL automatically translates SQL-like queries into MapReduce jobs which will execute on Hadoop.

Main parts of Hive are:

Metastore – It stores the metadata.
Driver – Manage the lifecycle of a HiveQL statement.
Query compiler – Compiles HiveQL into Directed Acyclic Graph(DAG).
Hive server – Provide a thrift interface and JDBC/ODBC server.

Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure tool to process structured data in Hadoop. It resides on top of Hadoop to summarize Big Data, and makes querying and analyzing easy.

2)a)Which part of the US has the most Data Engineer jobs for each year?

a)create table hide2011(worksite string, job_title string, year string, total string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile;

insert overwrite table hide2011 select worksite, job_title, year, count(*) as total from h1b_final where year = 2011 and  lower(job_title) like '%data engineer%' group by worksite, year, job_title order by total desc limit 10;

2)b)find top 5 locations in the US who have got certified visa for each year.[certified]

create table hello2011(worksite string, case_status string, year string, total string)
row format delimited
fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile;

insert overwrite table hello2011 select worksite, case_status, year, count(*) as total from h1b_final where year = 2011 and case_status = 'CERTIFIED' group by worksite, case_status, year order by total desc limit 5;

4)

create table year2011(employer_name string, year string, petition string)row format delimited
fields terminated by ','
stored as textfile;


insert overwrite table year2011 select employer_name, year, count(*) as petition from h1b_final where year = 2011 group by year, employer_name order by petition desc limit 5;


// create a seperate table for each year from 2011-2016 year2011-year2016 

//perform union command on all the 6 tables to join them.


 select * from year2011 union select * from year2012 union select * from year2013 union select * from year2014 union select * from year2015 union select * from year2016 order by year;

5)a)

select job title, count(*) as total  from h1b_final group by job title order by total desc limit 10;

5)b)

create 6 tables 
create table table name(job_title string, year string, total string )
row format delimited
fields terminated by '\t'
stored as textfile;

insert overwrite table hive2011 select job_title, count(*) as total, year from h1b_final where year = 2011 and lower(case_status) = 'certified' group by year, job_title order by total desc limit 10;
